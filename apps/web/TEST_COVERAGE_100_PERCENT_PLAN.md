## 📋 Test Creation Template

```tsx
/**
 * ComponentName Component Tests
 * 
 * Comprehensive test suite covering:
 * - Rendering with different props
 * - User interactions
 * - Edge cases
 * - Accessibility
 */

import React from 'react';
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { axe } from 'jest-axe';
import ComponentName from '../ComponentName';

describe('ComponentName Component', () => {
  describe('Rendering', () => {
    it('renders with required props', () => {
      render(<ComponentName prop="value" />);
      expect(screen.getByText('Expected Text')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });

  describe('Interactions', () => {
    it('handles user interactions correctly', () => {
      const handleClick = vi.fn();
      render(<ComponentName onClick={handleClick} />);

  describe('Edge Cases', () => {
    it('handles edge cases gracefully', () => {
      // Test edge cases
    });
  });
});
```

## 🚨 Safety Checks Before Each Commit

Before committing each batch, verify:

1. ✅ **TypeScript**: `pnpm type-check` passes
2. ✅ **Linting**: `pnpm lint` passes
3. ✅ **Tests**: `pnpm test` - all tests pass
4. ✅ **Coverage**: `pnpm test:coverage` - coverage increased or maintained
5. ✅ **No Regressions**: Existing tests still pass
6. ✅ **Documentation**: Plan document updated

## 🔄 Resuming After Interruption

If work is interrupted, follow these steps to resume:

1. **Check Current Status**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -10
   git status
   ```

2. **Review Last Checkpoint**
   - Check this document for last completed batch
   - Review git commits for what was done
   - Check test coverage report

3. **Verify Environment**
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   pnpm install
   pnpm type-check
   pnpm test
   ```

4. **Resume from Next Batch**
   - Start with the next batch marked "Not Started"
   - Follow the batch workflow checklist
   - Update progress as you go

5. **If Tests Fail**
   - Review error messages
   - Check if dependencies need updating
   - Fix issues before proceeding

## 🎯 Deployment Readiness

At any checkpoint, the codebase should be:
- ✅ TypeScript clean
- ✅ Lint clean
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Coverage documented
- ✅ Git committed and pushed

**Deployment Decision Points:**
- After each batch (incremental deployment)
- After critical path batches (Billing, Auth)
- At major milestones (50%, 75%, 100%)

## 📝 Notes

- Some components may need mocking (e.g., RichTextEditor, VideoPlayer)
- Some components may need integration test setup (e.g., components with API calls)
