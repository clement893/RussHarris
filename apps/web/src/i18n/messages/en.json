And often there's co-occurence with trauma, depression, anxiety disorders, or addiction. This two-day in person workshop will teach you how to modify, adapt and apply ACT flexibly and effectively with the full range of clinical issues commonly found in neurodivergent populations. (The focus is on adults, but everything is relevant and easily adaptable to adolescents.)",
    "programGoodNews1": "The good news: thanks to social justice movements all around the globe, stigma, prejudice, and discrimination against neurodivergent people is falling.",
    "programBadNews": "The bad news: many neurodivergent (ND) folk struggle greatly, as they grapple with the difficulties of life in a neurotypical world. Often, they have a long and painful history of trauma and rejection, and repeated subjection to prejudice, discrimination, or bullying. Hardly surprising then that mental health issues are pervasive in ND populations, and dual or triple diagnoses are common.",

    "oneSize1": "When you've met one neurodivergent person … you've met one neurodivergent person! Every ND client has their own unique set of problems, strengths, and needs – so we need to tailor what we do to suit each unique individual.",
    "oneSize2": "That's why you'll learn to use multi-purpose tools, and highly flexible strategies, easily modifiable to suit different issues. For example, you'll learn how to quickly analyse the function of literally any problematic behaviour – from 'meltdowns' and 'doom-scrolling' to self-harming and substance abuse – and use this information to target the behaviour precisely and effectively.",
