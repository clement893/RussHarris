## ⚠️ Critical Issues

### 1. **Security: Token Storage** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

**Location:** `apps/web/src/lib/auth/tokenStorage.ts`

**Issue:** Using `sessionStorage` for JWT tokens is vulnerable to XSS attacks. Tokens stored in `sessionStorage` can be accessed by any JavaScript running on the page.

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
// Consider using httpOnly cookies instead
// Or implement a more secure storage mechanism with encryption
```

**Impact:** High - Sensitive authentication tokens exposed to XSS attacks

---

### 2. **Security: Middleware Authentication** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

**Location:** `apps/web/src/middleware.ts`

**Issue:** The middleware doesn't actually verify JWT tokens. It only checks for public routes but doesn't validate tokens for protected routes. The comments acknowledge this limitation.

**Current Code:**
```typescript
// La vérification réelle se fera côté client et serveur (API)
// Pour l'instant, on laisse passer et la vérification se fait côté client
```

**Recommendation:**
- Implement proper JWT verification in middleware
- Use httpOnly cookies for tokens
- Verify token signature and expiration server-side

**Impact:** High - Protected routes are not actually protected at the middleware level

---

### 3. **API Client: Token Refresh Race Condition** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Location:** `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts` (lines 61-113)

**Issue:** While there's a `refreshTokenPromise` queue, the implementation has a potential race condition. If multiple requests fail with 401 simultaneously, they might all try to refresh.

**Current Implementation:**
```typescript
if (!refreshTokenPromise) {
  refreshTokenPromise = axios.post(...)
}
```

**Recommendation:**
- Ensure all pending requests wait for the same refresh promise
- Add request queuing mechanism
- Consider using a more robust token refresh library

---

## 🔧 Code Quality Issues

### 1. **TODO Comments** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Locations:**
- `apps/web/src/app/subscriptions/page.tsx` (4 TODOs)
- `apps/web/src/app/admin/teams/page.tsx` (2 TODOs)
- `apps/web/src/app/admin/invitations/page.tsx` (3 TODOs)

**Issue:** Multiple TODO comments indicating incomplete implementations, particularly around API calls using mock data.

**Recommendation:**
- Replace mock data with actual API calls
- Remove TODOs once implemented
- Consider creating GitHub issues for tracking

---

### 2. **Console Statements** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Locations:**
- `apps/web/src/app/subscriptions/page.tsx:112` - `console.error`
- `apps/web/src/app/components/data/DataContent.tsx` - Multiple `console.log` statements

**Issue:** ESLint allows `console.warn` and `console.error`, but `console.log` statements should be replaced with proper logging.

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
// Replace console.log with logger
import { logger } from '@/lib/logger';
logger.debug('Sélection:', { selected });
```

---

### 3. **Mixed Language Comments** 🟢 LOW PRIORITY

**Issue:** Comments are mixed between French and English throughout the codebase.

**Recommendation:**
- Standardize on one language (preferably English for international teams)
- Or document the language choice in CONTRIBUTING.md

---

### 4. **ProtectedRoute Component** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Location:** `apps/web/src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`

**Issue:** The component uses client-side redirects which can cause flash of content. Also, the loading state is hardcoded in French.

**Recommendation:**
- Consider server-side protection using middleware
- Use i18n for internationalization
- Add proper loading skeleton component

---

## 📊 Testing Coverage

### Current State:
- ✅ Vitest configured for unit tests
- ✅ Playwright configured for E2E tests
- ✅ Test setup files present
- ⚠️ Coverage thresholds set to 70% (good target)

### Recommendations:
1. **Increase test coverage** - Many components lack tests
2. **Add integration tests** for API client
3. **Add tests for error handling** scenarios
4. **Test token refresh flow** thoroughly

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Recommendations

### 1. **State Management**
- ✅ Good use of Zustand for auth state
- ✅ Proper persistence configuration
- ⚠️ Consider if more global state is needed (React Query for server state?)

### 2. **API Layer**
- ✅ Well-structured API client
- ✅ Good error handling
- ⚠️ Consider using React Query or SWR for better caching and state management

### 3. **Component Architecture**
- ✅ Good separation of Server/Client Components
- ✅ Proper use of `'use client'` directive
- ✅ Good use of `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` where needed

---

## 🚀 Performance Recommendations

### 1. **Bundle Size**
- ✅ Bundle analyzer configured
- ⚠️ Monitor bundle size regularly
- Consider code splitting for large pages

### 2. **Image Optimization**
- ✅ Next.js Image component configured
- ✅ Proper formats (AVIF, WebP)
- ✅ Good device sizes configuration

### 3. **Lazy Loading**
- ✅ Custom lazy loading utilities
- ✅ Proper Suspense boundaries
- ⚠️ Consider using Next.js `dynamic()` for route-based code splitting

---

## 📝 Documentation

### Strengths:
- ✅ Good JSDoc comments in utility functions
- ✅ Type definitions are self-documenting
- ✅ README structure present

### Improvements Needed:
- ⚠️ Add API documentation
- ⚠️ Add component documentation (Storybook is configured but needs stories)
- ⚠️ Add deployment documentation
- ⚠️ Add environment variable documentation

---

## 🔒 Security Checklist

- [x] TypeScript strict mode enabled
- [x] ESLint security rules configured
- [x] Error handling doesn't expose sensitive info
- [ ] **Token storage security** (needs improvement)
- [ ] **Middleware authentication** (needs implementation)
- [ ] **CSRF protection** (not visible in code)
- [ ] **Rate limiting** (not visible in frontend code)
- [x] Security headers configured in `next.config.js`
- [ ] **Content Security Policy** (not configured)

---

## 🎨 Code Style & Consistency

### Strengths:
- ✅ Consistent file naming
- ✅ Good component structure
- ✅ Proper TypeScript usage

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Consistent error handling** - Some places use try/catch, others use error boundaries
2. **Consistent loading states** - Different loading patterns across components
3. **Consistent error messages** - Mix of French and English

---

## 📈 Metrics & Monitoring

### Current State:
- ✅ Sentry integration for error tracking
- ✅ Logger utility configured
- ✅ Monitoring types defined

### Recommendations:
- ⚠️ Add performance monitoring (Web Vitals)
- ⚠️ Add user analytics (if needed)
- ⚠️ Add API response time monitoring

---

## 🐛 Potential Bugs

### 1. **Token Refresh Error Handling**
**Location:** `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts:91-95`

If refresh fails, it redirects but also throws an error. This might cause issues with error handling in components.

### 2. **ProtectedRoute Dependency Array**
**Location:** `apps/web/src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx:44`

The `useEffect` dependency array includes `isAuthenticated` which is a function. This might cause unnecessary re-renders.

---

## ✅ Best Practices Followed

1. ✅ Proper use of React hooks
2. ✅ TypeScript strict mode
3. ✅ Error boundaries and error handling
4. ✅ Proper Next.js App Router patterns
5. ✅ Code splitting and lazy loading
6. ✅ Security headers configured
7. ✅ Proper environment variable handling
8. ✅ Good separation of concerns

---

## 🎯 Priority Action Items

### High Priority:
1. **Fix token storage security** - Move to httpOnly cookies
2. **Implement proper middleware authentication** - Verify JWT tokens server-side
3. **Replace TODO comments** - Implement missing API calls

### Medium Priority:
4. **Replace console.log statements** - Use logger utility

- i18n library for internationalization
- React Hook Form for form management (if not already using)

### 2. **Consider Refactoring:**
- API client to use React Query hooks
- Error handling to use error boundaries more consistently
- Loading states to use Suspense more effectively

### 3. **Consider Removing:**
- Unused dependencies (audit with `pnpm audit`)
- Dead code
- Commented-out code
